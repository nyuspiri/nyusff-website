FESTIVAL HISTORY

The NYU Sports Film Festival (NYUSFF) is a sports-themed film festival that was created to showcase and celebrate the powerful intersection of sports and film. The festival is co-produced by the NYU Production Lab, NYU Athletics, and the NYU Tisch Institute of Global Sport, with support from NYU Tisch Undergraduate Film & TV and SNY. The student-run festival draws engaging short films that tell nuanced stories in sports from all over the world.



“From Raging Bull to He Got Game to The Rider, NYU filmmakers have brought powerful sports stories to the screen. The NYU Sports Film Festival celebrates that great tradition.” – John Tintori, director, screenwriter, and Oscar-winning film editor


 
NYUSFF began virtually in 2021, partnering with SNY on a television special.

In 2022, the 2nd Annual Special was broadcast multiple times, featuring award-winning films and event highlights from the festival. Creators of the Religion of Sports Final Four were awarded with cash prizes and an additional screening at the Catalyst Content Festival. The festival featured speakers from executives at HBOSports, NFLFilms, ESPN, and Religion of Sports, as well as acclaimed guests such as Billy Crudup (Actor: The Morning Show, Almost Famous, Without Limits), Reinaldo Marcus Green (Director: 6x Academy Award nominated film King Richard, Monsters and Men), and Spencer Paysinger (inspiration for the hit show All American).


 
In 2023, the 3rd Annual Festival featured 12 official selections from around the world screened at the Village East by Angelika, where honoree Q&As were held with Laurie Hernandez (Olympic medal-winning gymnast) and Jeremiah Zagar (Director: Hustle, We the Animals). The events also included speaker panels featuring WME Agents Carlos Fleming and Benjamin Simone, as well as award-winning producers Carolyn Hepburn, George Veras, and Andrew Mayz. After the convention of the jury, which included representatives from media companies such as Point Road Productions and Cinetic Media, the festival also hosted a networking reception and awards ceremony. The 3rd Annual SNY Special featured four award-winning films, festival event highlights, and director interviews. The show broadcast eight times over August and September of 2023, and four official selections re-screened at the Catalyst Content Festival and Lake Placid Film Festival.



In 2024, the 4th Annual Festival featured 19 official selections and 5 honorable mentions out of 150 submissions from 18 different countries. During the first weekend, screenings were held at the iconic Angelika Film Center, where filmmakers from around the world had a chance to speak in front of a packed theater before their films. Back at the NYU Production Lab, NYUSFF hosted a panel including Sports Emmy winning editor Anthony Cortese, Associate Producer/Director for CBS Sports Rachel Wagner, Emmy nominated Executive Vice President at Topic Studios Ryan Heller, and NCAA Division III Champion athlete Morgan Morrison. It was also the debut year of NYUSFF’s Pitch Contest, featuring presentations from selected filmmakers in front of esteemed sports media producers from Madison Square Garden Sports, SaChin Productions, Black Lion TV, and Point Road Productions. For the second weekend, NYUSFF welcomed Ted Lasso Creator and Screenwriter Bill Lawrence for an Honoree Q&A and screened student films from NYU’s first ever Sports Documentary Course.
